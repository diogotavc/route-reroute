- [ ] ~~add look back camera~~
- [ ] ~~visually separate achievements by type~~
- [ ] ~~fix t-bone achievement~~
- [ ] ~~balance out achievements (wrecked and ruined can be 10 crashes, instead of 1; lawn enforcement can be for a few meters; terminal velocity can be for enough time)~~
- [ ] ~~shows stats at the end of the level~~
