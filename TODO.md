### Fixes

- [ ] complete the third level before 0.4-alpha (which will be good enough for delivery)
- [ ] prevent esc on the initial level selection screen
- [ ] _shows stats at the end of the level?_
- [ ] bug with the pause menu level selector in sandbox mode

### Features still yet to be added

- [ ] SFX (UI, crashes, car engines, other fx)
- [ ] add vehicle specific lights and sounds (i.e. ambulance)

### Right before delivery

- [ ] check for unused variables and bad imports
- [ ] look over the configs before prod
- [ ] look for stupid logs
- [ ] add log for graphics setting
- [ ] remove debug / check for console.* (including 'n' key)
- [ ] add last level finishing logic

### maybe?

- [?] add look back camera
- [?] separate achievements by type
- [?] fix t-bone achievement
- [?] balance out achievements (wrecked and ruined can be 10 crashes, instead of 1; lawn enforcement can be for a few meters; terminal velocity can be for enough time)

### not planned anymore

- [-] ~~save system~~ (in favour of the "play a different level" system)
- [-] ~~Add dialogs for each mission~~ (too late)
- [-] ~~Selectable OST (lists files in the designated folder, and let's you toggle it)~~ (no time)
- [-] ~~add support for physics based objects (construction barrier, cone and light)~~ (too complex, too late)
- [-] ~~fix first person headlight issue~~
- [-] ~~firefly should flicker more often, not just at the beginning~~
- [-] ~~streetlight and road/building layout are literally not built the same (matrixes are interpreted backwards)~~

- [-] ~~pause music in the pause menu~~
- [-] ~~Menus (keyboard driven, but supporting mice)~~

        - [-] ~~add steering and pedal gauges specific to the gamepad (analog support)~~
- [-] ~~turn config.js constants into variables that can be changed through the UI~~
