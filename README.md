## Project Idea

A simple clone of the game [Does Not Commute](https://www.mediocre.se/commute/), built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for 3D rendering. The goal is to create a minimalistic, top-down driving game where players control vehicles in a small town, with each level's actions affecting subsequent levels, displaying diverse lighting and interactivity.

## Project Name

The project is likely to be named **Route Reroute**, but there are other candidates:

- Traffic Tango
- Rush Hour Madness
- Late Again!
- DoppelDrivers

## Core Features and Requirements

1. Core Gameplay

    - Each vehicleâ€™s path is recorded as the player drives. In subsequent turns, all prior routes replay simultaneously, turning the player's past turns into obstacles.
    - As the level progresses, the town becomes a huge traffic jam. The objective is to avoid collisions at all costs.
    - Steering-only player controlled vehicles with no ability to decelerate or brake.
    - A timer to complete the whole level, incremeted with every completed level.
    - Unique vehicle and destination for each turn.

2. Visual Style

    - Top-down 3D view of a small town with roads, intersections, and buildings.
    - Minimalist and cartoonish art style with a retro-modern aesthetic.

3. Physics and Collisions

    - Vehicles should interact realistically with each other and the environment.
    - Enough vehicle causes the player to end the game.

4. Progression and Difficulty

    - Start with simple routes and gradually introduce more complex routes and faster, more challenging, vehicles.

5. Stretch Goals (Optional)

    - Alternative cameras, such as a cockpit or chase view.
    - Sandbox mode where players can freely experiment with any of the already driven vehicles.
    - Cheat codes to allow players to play the game at their own volition.
    - Include sound effects and background music to enhance the experience.
