== Route Reroute (demo available over at https://youtu.be/V9SRdY5qQvo[YouTube])

A simple clone of the game https://www.mediocre.se/commute/[Does Not Commute], built using https://threejs.org/[Three.js] for 3D rendering. The goal is to create a minimalistic, driving game where players control vehicles in a small town, with each level's actions affecting subsequent levels, displaying diverse lighting and interactivity.

Since the project has been delivered, the link:./TODO.md[list of tasks] has now become a graveyard of planned features.
