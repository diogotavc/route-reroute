== Route Reroute

A simple clone of the game https://www.mediocre.se/commute/[Does Not Commute], built using https://threejs.org/[Three.js] for 3D rendering. The goal is to create a minimalistic, top-down driving game where players control vehicles in a small town, with each level's actions affecting subsequent levels, displaying diverse lighting and interactivity.
