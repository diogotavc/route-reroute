# Route Reroute

## Project Idea

A simple clone of the game [Does Not Commute](https://www.mediocre.se/commute/), built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for 3D rendering. The goal is to create a minimalistic driving game where players control vehicles sequentially in a small town. Each vehicle's path is recorded and replayed in subsequent turns, creating increasingly complex traffic scenarios that the player must navigate.

## Core features

### Gameplay Loop

- Each vehicleâ€™s path is recorded as the player drives. In subsequent turns, all prior routes replay simultaneously, turning the player's past actions into dynamic obstacles.
- As the level progresses, the town becomes increasingly congested with the replayed vehicles. The objective is to reach the destination without collisions.
- Player controls acceleration, braking, and steering for each vehicle.
- Unique vehicle, starting point, and destination for each turn within a level.
- **Planned:** A timer tracks the overall level completion time, potentially increased with each completed turn.
- **Planned:** A health/damage system where collisions impact the vehicle. If health is depleted, the current turn might be rewindable at the cost of a time penalty (specific mechanic TBD). The current implementation features a manual rewind ('R' key) for debugging and testing.
- **Planned:** Gradually introduce more complex routes and vehicles with varying handling characteristics.

### Visual Style

- Third-person 3D camera following the active vehicle.
- Environment features a small town with roads, intersections, and potentially simple buildings.
- Minimalist and cartoonish 3D graphics using Kenney assets.
- Focus on clear visuals, simple shapes, and a clean aesthetic.

### Physics and Collisions

- Custom physics model for vehicle movement (acceleration, braking, steering friction).
- Collision detection between vehicles using Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB) and the Separating Axis Theorem (SAT).
